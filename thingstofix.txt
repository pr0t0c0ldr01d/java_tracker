Need to process options, need option to verify copy. Probably should verify right after copy and print result, also md5sum to check no corruption

Need to build in verify or "scan only" option.

Need to handle case where file is found in Java directory...skip

Need input file to be hosts only. Need to input deduplicated hosts

Perhaps build in functionality to query nexpose API for list of affected hosts, or get it from active directory
